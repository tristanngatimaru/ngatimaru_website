# Performance Analysis and Monitoring

## What I Found - Potential Performance Bottlenecks

Based on my analysis of your code, here are the likely causes of slow first load times:

### 1. **Heavy API Calls on Initial Load**

- Your `loadSiteContent()` function in `src/api/siteContent.js` fetches data for **ALL pages** (home, about, documents, fishing permits, etc.) on every page load
- This happens even when the user only visits the home page
- This could be making 6+ parallel API calls to Strapi on every initial load

### 2. **Large Font Files Loading**

- You're loading 6 different Roboto font files (Thin, Light, Regular, Medium, SemiBold, Bold)
- Each font file is likely 100-300KB
- These are loaded synchronously in your CSS

### 3. **External Font Loading**

- You're also loading Google Fonts via CDN in your `index.html`
- This creates a dependency on external servers

### 4. **Potential Bundle Size Issues**

- Heavy dependencies like `framer-motion`, `@radix-ui` components
- Multiple form components that might be bundled even when not needed

### 5. **Image Loading**

- Large header images that are loaded immediately
- No lazy loading or optimization visible

## Performance Monitoring Added

I've added comprehensive console logging to help you identify exactly where the bottlenecks are:

### 🚀 Main.jsx Timing

- Tracks React import time
- Tracks CSS loading time
- Tracks App component import time
- Overall execution time

### 📦 App.jsx Component Loading

- Tracks when lazy-loaded components are imported
- Shows which components take longest to load

### 🏠 Home Page Monitoring

- Content loading timing
- API call duration
- Component initialization time

### 🔗 API Layer Monitoring

- Individual API request timing
- Network request vs JSON parsing time
- Response size tracking
- URL and header logging

### 📥 Site Content Loading

- Parallel fetch timing
- Individual page content fetch timing
- Data transformation timing

### 📰 Posts Component

- Blog posts API timing
- Data transformation timing

## How to Use the Performance Logs

1. **Open your browser's Developer Tools** (F12)
2. **Go to the Console tab**
3. **Reload your page**
4. **Look for these patterns:**

```
🚀 main.jsx starting...
✅ React core imported successfully (Xms)
✅ CSS imported (Xms)
✅ App component imported (Xms)
📦 App.jsx: Starting component imports...
🏠 Home component: Starting initialization...
🔗 API: Starting fetch for home...
📥 SiteContent: Starting to load all site content...
```

## Expected Performance Issues to Look For

### ⚠️ **Slow API Calls (>500ms)**

```
🔗 API: home fetch completed (1200ms)  ← This is slow!
```

### ⚠️ **Large Response Sizes**

```
🔗 API: Response size: 150000 characters  ← This is large!
```

### ⚠️ **Multiple Parallel Calls**

```
📥 SiteContent: Will fetch 6 pages: home, about, documents, fishingPermit, mataiWhetu, register
```

### ⚠️ **Slow Component Loading**

```
✅ Home component loaded (800ms)  ← This is slow!
```

## Recommended Optimizations

### 1. **Lazy Load Site Content**

Instead of loading all page content upfront, only load content for the current page:

```javascript
// Instead of loadSiteContent(), use:
const homeContent = await getHomeContent(); // Only load what you need
```

### 2. **Optimize Font Loading**

- Use `font-display: swap` for custom fonts
- Consider reducing the number of font weights
- Use system fonts as fallbacks

### 3. **Image Optimization**

- Add lazy loading to images
- Use WebP format where possible
- Implement responsive images

### 4. **Bundle Optimization**

- Code splitting is already configured in your Vite config
- Consider preloading critical chunks

### 5. **API Optimization**

- Implement caching for rarely-changing content
- Reduce API response sizes
- Use CDN for static assets

## Monitoring Commands

After implementing these logs, run your app and check the console. Look for:

- Total load times over 2000ms
- Individual API calls over 500ms
- Large response sizes (>50KB)
- Components taking >300ms to load

The logs will help you identify the specific bottleneck in your application!
